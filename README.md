#### _A React Tutorial, 11/13/18_

#### By _**Luke Vandekieft & Ben Kiggen**_

## Description

_Today we followed along with React's official tutorial to get a better idea of how it functions. As an added challenge we chose to split up the three main sections into separate components which challenged our concepts of data transfer, state, and class vs. function formatting._
